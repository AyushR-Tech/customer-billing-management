## 🎯 Overview

This billing system is designed for small retail businesses to efficiently manage customer transactions. The project includes two implementations demonstrating different programming paradigms:

- **C Version**: Procedural approach using structures and functions
- **C++ Version**: Object-oriented approach with classes and encapsulation

### Key Capabilities
- Multi-customer transaction processing
- Dynamic product entry per customer
- Automated GST (18%) calculation
- Customer loyalty discount system (5% new, 10% old)
- Professional invoice generation

## 🧮 Calculation Logic

### GST Calculation (18%)
```
Amount with GST = Quantity × Price × 1.18
```

### Discount Application
```
Subtotal = Sum of all products with GST
Discount % = 10% (Old Customer) or 5% (New Customer)
Discount Amount = Subtotal × (Discount % / 100)
Final Bill = Subtotal - Discount Amount
```

### Example
```
Product: Laptop, Price: ₹50,000, Quantity: 1
Amount with GST = 1 × 50,000 × 1.18 = ₹59,000

Old Customer (10% discount):
Final Bill = ₹59,000 - ₹5,900 = ₹53,100
```
